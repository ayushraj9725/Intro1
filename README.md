# Intro1
add new Intro1
now we want to change in main directory on code editor and some messagae want to add into github , then we have to check status 
and need to know about types of status modified , unmodified , untracked , stage 
modified - some change doing on code editor ,and it is not add into github
unmodified - changed and add into github
untracked - any file create in local system not upload on remote system on(github)
stage - part of state , ready to be commit

if we also want to create new file that we can cteate it on code editor that is called untracked file , so we have to add it also

so we can add one by one file by run command (git add filename ) if we want to add all together we can run (git add.)
and also we have to take screensort of this that is called commit so run (git commit -m "some meaasge about changes ")
